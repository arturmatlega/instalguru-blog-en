faq:
- question: How much wood do I need for roof trusses?
  answer: To calculate how much wood one needs for timber framing, you need a roof
    truss design plan. Determine the size of each element and multiply the length,
    width and height of each of them. Sum the results - this is the volume of wood
    you need.
- question: What are roof trusses?
  answer: Wood trusses build a wooden structure which makes the upper part of the
    building. They are the basis for roof coating, determining the final shape of
    the rooftop. They are sometimes referred  to as a "skeleton frame" of the roof.
- question: How much do roof trusses cost?
  answer: The price of roof trusses depends on the roof truss design itself. A simple
    gable roof is the cheapest option - all you need is collar beam or a kingpost
    truss. Hip roofs are definitely more expensive, and the more complicated the construction,
    the higher price.
