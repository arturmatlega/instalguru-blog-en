  answer: If you have noticed that the water pressure is low in your system, check
    the condition of the fittings - they might be broken. After eliminating this factor
    - check the pipes for any leaks. Another possible reason might be a clog inside
    the pipework. If you have checked all those issues and everything is in order
    - you are probably going to need some additional equipment.
