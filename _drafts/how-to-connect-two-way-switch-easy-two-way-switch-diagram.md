## Two way light switch - what are its features?

There is probably not too many people who are not electricians and pay attention to devices such as light switches. It is enough that they serve their function - that is, turn the light on and off. These devices, however, concern exactly the matter of funtionality - there are many types of them, and choosing the right one might not be that obvious for a layman.

Specialists classify light switches in accordance to several criterions. The most common types are:

* **Surface and flush-mounted light switches** - the differentiation concerns the installation method.
* **Single and double-pole switches** - the first ones control a single light source,whereas the latter can control two light bulbs at the same time.
* **Multi-pole switches** - they control more light sources and usually have two or more buttons.
* **Automatic switches** - they switch off the light automatically after a given time.

Judging by aesthetics, one can also distinguish light switches according to the type of buttons. Manufacturers offer traditional switches with a mechanical button. Touch light switches are gaining popularity. They have smooth panel with a sensor which reacts to touch.
