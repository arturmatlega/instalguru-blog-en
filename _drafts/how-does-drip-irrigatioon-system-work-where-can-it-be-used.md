* **Drip irrigation means saving water.** With traditional sprinkling, water is distributed to relatively random spots. The plants are moisturised, however some of the water doesn't get where iit's supposed to. This leads, as it has been laready mentioned, to waste. Drip watering system proivides water precisely where a plant's root system is.
* **Such system requires only minimal attention.** After a drip line is installed, all one needs to do is turn on the water and adjust the pressure level. There is also another option – to make the process completely automatic. It can be done by using a special controlling device which can automatically turn on the water at a particular part of the day, for a given amount of time. The most advanced controllers can even react to weather changes.
* **The water distributed to plants is of the highest quality.** A drip irrigation system should be equipped with an appropriate filter. It protects the installation, and the user doesn't have to worry about the plants being damaged by contaminated water.
* **A micro irrigation system makes gardening much easier.** It means not only easier watering, but also comfortable plants feeding. A drip line is perfect for distributing a fertiliser. To do this, one only needs to equip it with a special fertiliser injector.
* **A drip irrigation system means lesser risk of plant diseases.** The water is distributed directly into soil, so that it has no contact with overground parts of the plants. It prevents spread of fungi and mould, which occur quite often when plants are sprinked from above. A drip line also eliminates the problem of burnt leaves.
