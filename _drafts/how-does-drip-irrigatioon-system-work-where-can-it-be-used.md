## What is a drip irrigation system?

Drip irrigation is one of the most **advanced method** of plant watering. It involves automatic water distribution, which saves a lot of time and energy. Compared to standard methods – a watering can or a garden hose, a drip irrigation system is much more efficient.

**In times when droughts are becoming increasingly regular, keeping the right moisture level is the most important part of plant care.** The standard methods of watering, however, are not only ineffective but also very wasteful. Even the most experienced gardener is not able to water a plant with 100% precision, to provide enough moisture without any loss. It would simply take too much time. A drip line used for watering system is a perfect solution for this problem. It's a method which uses a set of tubes to transport the exact amount of water that is needed.

## How does a drip line work?

A drip irrigation system is a very simple installation. Its **main part is a drip line** – in some cases a **drip tape**. Either of those elements should be connected with a source of water, which flows through a system of pipes placed on the ground. Water drops drip out of tiny holes and water the plants – hence the name of the method. **Thanks to this solution, the roots system always has access to water, across the whole area covered by the system.** The moisture level can be easily adjusted by turning the tap in the right direction.

## What are the advantages of drip irrigation?

A drip line is a unique solution of many advantages. It can save a lot of time, money and resources. Why should one consider a drip irrigation system in your garden?

{:.list.list-positive}

* **Drip irrigation means saving water.** With the traditional sprinkling, water is distributed to relatively random spots. The plants are moisturised, however some of the water doesn't get where it's supposed to. This leads, as it has been already mentioned, to waste. Drip watering system provides water precisely where a plant's root system is.
* **Such system requires only minimal attention.** After a drip line is installed, all one needs to do is turn on the water and adjust the pressure level. There is also another option – to make the process completely automatic. It can be done by using a special controlling device which can automatically turn on the water at a particular part of the day, for a given amount of time. The most advanced controllers can even react to weather changes.
* **The water distributed to plants is of the highest quality.** A drip irrigation system should be equipped with an appropriate filter. It protects the installation, and the user doesn't have to worry about the plants being damaged by contaminated water.
* **A micro-irrigation system makes gardening much easier.** It means not only easier watering, but also comfortable plants feeding. A drip line is perfect for distributing a fertiliser. To do this, one only needs to equip it with a special fertiliser injector.
* **A drip irrigation system means lesser risk of plant diseases.** The water is distributed directly into soil, so that it has no contact with overground parts of the plants. It prevents spread of fungi and mould, which occur quite often when plants are sprinkled from above. A drip line also eliminates the problem of sunburnt leaves.
* **Such system might contribute to a better vegetable, fruit and herb harvest.** A drip watering system results in a better plant care and independence from the water conditions. There is no need to worry that a drought will destroy the crops.

## Where can one use a drip irrigation system?

Because drip lines can cover even large areas, it's a **recommended and frequently used system for croplands**. It's a good way to water plants such as strawberries, blueberries and fruit trees. The installation gives one full control over the amount of water transported to a plant. Thanks to this there is no threat of overwatering, which could cause decay process. It's an important aspect which might impact the quality of harvest.

Drip irrigation is also a perfect system for gardens. **A drip line will water flowerbeds, rock gardens and hedges.** It's also a good solution for potted plants. Interestingly, drip systems are becoming popular on balconies and patios.

{:.distinction.distinction-quotation.distinction-negative}

A drip irrigation system is not recommended for lawns. In this case it is advised to use traditional garden hose or sprinklers.

## Are there any disadvantages of drip irrigation?

Despite the undeniable benefits of a drip irrigation system, one should also know its disadvantages. It's a system that cannot be really moved around, therefore it should be used in case of perennials. A drip line, like every water installation, is susceptible to dirt, which might cause clogging. **Each element of the system should be controlled regularly.** Another problem might be difficulty to adjust watering intensity to the plants type – although it can be easily solved by using a splitter to create several drip lines.

## Drip watering system – what elements are needed to create an installation?

Drip irrigation is not a complicated system, and it's not difficult to install. Before doing that, one should equip themselves with all crucial components:

{:.list.list-positive}

* **Drip line** – a tube or a special tape used for watering. It's an element that can be placed directly on the ground, or it can be covered with soil.
* **Emitters** – they are attached to the drip line and placed right by the plant.
* **Water filter** – an essential part of a micro-irrigation system. It removes any water contamination and prevents the system failures.
* **Additional components** – depending on the particular type of a drip irrigation system, one can use stakes for holding the drip lines and emitters, band clips, connectors and splitters.
* **Irrigation controller** – although it's an optional element, it's a recommended investment. It allows for full control and automation of the process.

### A drip line – which is better: tubes or tapes?

Construction of a drip irrigation system requires making the decision on the method of water distribution. There are several options. **The most popular ones are drip hose and drip tape.** Which is the better one? It mostly depends on what you are going to water and what are your possibilities.

{:.distinction.distinction-info.distinction-positive}

A drip tape is typically used for small vegetable and fruit crops, flower beds and potted plants. A drip irrigation that uses a system of tubes is perfect for watering hedges, smaller trees and orchards. In the last case it is advised to combine the drip irrigation with additional water distribution points – sprinklers.

## Drip irrigation system installation – how to do it yourself?

There are many companies that offer the installation of drip lines. It's a very useful service when a drip irrigation system is going to cover a large area, such as a large cropland. **If you want to install a small, uncomplicated micro-irrigation system in your garden, you can do it yourself.** It's not very difficult.

Depending on the line you choose, place a hose or a tape on the ground. Usually, it is held by a set of special stakes. **Some systems can be buried underground**. Arrange the lines so that they lay right by the plants. The next step involves installation of emitters (if they are included in the system). Connect the drip line with a source of water. If needed, split the line using several tubes.

The simplest drip irrigation systems are controlled by turning the tap on or off. **Manufacturers offer special irrigation controllers.** Using them, one can plan watering for a particular day and hour. Thanks to this solution, a drip irrigation can run by itself and doesn't require too much attention.

## Drip irrigation system – estimated costs

Are you wondering how expensive a drip irrigation system is? As most installations of this type, the price depends on individual factors. One should consider the area that is supposed to be covered by the system. This aspect dictates the number of drip lines that one needs to install. **The price obviously also depends on the manufacturer, therefore it is advised to compare the quality and value of available brands.**

{:.distinction.distinction-info.distinction-positive}

The less complicated the installation is, the less it costs. For this reason one should consider all solutions that could be used in a particular case. Small designs can surely give up electronic controllers, unless convenience is the priority. One can also decrease the costs by choosing to install the system by themselves.

## What else should one remember when installing drip irrigation?

Because all gardens are different, one should pay attention to every detail when choosing a drip irrigation system: from the shape of terrain to drip line colour. This way one can **create a system that will match all needs and serve for years.**

{:.list.list-positive}

* Is your garden situated on a hill or uneven terrain? It doesn't mean that drip irrigation is not for you. Just use a **pressure regulator** – a device that will allow the water to flow upwards.
* Remember that the way **the emitters are placed** depends mostly on the type of soil your plants grow in. The more loose the ground is, the more emitters you need. If the soil is quite dense, place them more sparsely to prevent water retention.
* What hose colour to choose? **The most popular drip lines are available in neutral colours: green, black or brown.** Thanks to this one can easily mask the tube and increase the aesthetics of the garden. You could also choose stronger colours and expose the hose for decorative purposes.
* What do to with drip lines after the season's ended? **The equipment should be put away for winter** so that it is not damaged by the weather conditions.
* Are you expanding the crops area and the drip irrigation system covers only a part of it? **You can always extend the drip lines**. To do this, use special connectors.

**A drip irrigation system is a perfect solution for every garden.** Thanks to it you can easily and effortlessly take care of your plants. A drip line means not only time and money saved, but also a beautiful and healthy looking garden. It's a universal system that can be used both for professional farming as well as for private gardens, balconies and patios.
