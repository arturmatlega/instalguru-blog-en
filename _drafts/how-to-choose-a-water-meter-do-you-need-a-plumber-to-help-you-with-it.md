intro: Every building, regardless of its purpose, has a plumbing system. It's the
  most important system and the absolute basis - already at the stage of finishing
  the building. Many important activities are impossible without having an access
  to water. When the plumber connects the property with water line, one has to remember
  about a water meter.

faq:
- question: How to seal a water meter?
  answer: Only an authorized person can seal or lock a water meter. You cannot seal
    a water meter yourself, so if you need to do it, you have to file an application
    with the right municipal establishment assigned to your region.
- question: How to read a water meter?
  answer: It's easy to read a water meter. The reading concerns black numbers on the
    panel - you have to note them with the zeros at the beginning. Modern models do
    not need to be read by the users, as the value is measured by an authorised person
    via a radio.
