  It doesn't matter where you are going to lay tiles - you should prepare yourself
  for a lot of work which requires much attention and high precision. Using traditional
  cross spacers is tedious and time consuming. It might also be quite problematic
  if you don't have much experience. But, it doesn't necessarily mean that you have
  to give up the idea of DIY tile installation. Just use the right tile leveling system.

    per 1 sq. metre, for 80x80 - 10 pairs per 1 sq. metre, and for tiles 100x50 -
    16 pairs per 1 sq. metre. Typically, you can find the information on the manufacturer's

  answer: The best tile leveling system is the one that fits particular needs like
    type of the tiles or their thickness. Some users prefer single-use systems, others
    choose reusable sets which are long term investments. It's important that the
    tile leveling system matches one's personal needs and skills.
