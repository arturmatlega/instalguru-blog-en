intro: Water is an element without which a human being wouldn't be able to function
  on a daily basis. It is used in many aspects of life such as cleaning, cooking,
  plants watering and direct consumption. While in certain cases its quality is not
  that important, drinking water is the most substantial in that matter. Water potability
  is typically determined by its taste quality and appearance. An increasing number
  of people decides that tap water is a better option than store-bought bottled water
  - provided that it has good quality. The problem is, however, that tap water is
  not always quite pure - therefore many homeowners decide to invest in special equipment
  like a water purifier or a home water filtration system.
