intro: Water is an element without which a human being wouldn't be able to function
  on a daily basis. It is used in many aspects of life such as cleaning, cooking,
  plants watering and direct consumption. While in certain cases its quality is not
  that important, drinking water is the most substantial in that matter. Water potability
  is typically determined by its taste quality and appearance. An increasing number
  of people decides that tap water is a better option than store-bought bottled water
  - provided that it has good quality. The problem is, however, that tap water is
  not always quite pure - therefore many homeowners decide to invest in special equipment
  like a water purifier or a home water filtration system.

## How is the taste and quality of water determined?

In accordance with the research by experts, there are many places where tap water contains far more ingredients that are good for health than store-bought bottled water. Nevertheless, people often give up drinking tap water - mostly because of its poor taste or smell. Are those features a sign of poor quality? Quite the contrary! **Unusual smell or taste are usually indicators of various processes used in water purification.** It is important, however, to evalute what kind of smell it is. Sometimes it might signify a lower quality of water and e.g. too high iron or calcium concentration.

If there are visible sediments and larger residues - dust and rust particles in tap water, it is quite a different matter. It doesn't indicate a low quality of water, but a poor condition of the plumbing. This problem can be resolved by special home water purifier. **It usually contains mechanical cartriges which stop any particles on their surface.**

Residues and small particles in a water system do not only influence the taste and quality of water. It might also cause damage in some elements of the system.

The chemical composition of water from water supply network in most cases is unquestionable. One should, however, pay attention to the smell and color of the liquid coming from own water supplies. If something seems suspicious and you detect a strange aftertaste: metallic, salty or bitter - you might want to make a research. You might also **get a sample of the water tested in a physico-chemical lab**, to make sure everything is alright.

## What is the reason for water taste issues?

Water taste is affected by many factors. The major role is played by chemical compounds. The condition of the plumbing and the temperature are also important aspects. **Each of them influences how the water looks and tastes**.

Many people are concerned about tap water quality. In reality, if the water is supplied from the local waterworks, the fear might be completely unjustified. Water supply providers are obliged to **constantly control the water quality - even several times a day**. In case of any irregularities, they are diagnosed immediately. If there is any problem, the water supply is temporarily cut off and a warning message is issued.

**A common for tap water chemical taste is a result of the dissinfection processes which use chlorine**. It is one of the most frequently mentioned problems reported by tap water users. It doesn't mean, however, that water from a well is flawless. In this case, a taste of iron is a common issue. Everything depends on the location and depth of the source.
