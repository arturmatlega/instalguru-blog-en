intro: Water is an element without which a human being wouldn't be able to function
  on a daily basis. It is used in many aspects of life such as cleaning, cooking,
  plants watering and direct consumption. While in certain cases its quality is not
  that important, drinking water is the most substantial in that matter. Water potability
  is typically determined by its taste quality and appearance. An increasing number
  of people decides that tap water is a better option than store-bought bottled water
  - provided that it has good quality. The problem is, however, that tap water is
  not always quite pure - therefore many homeowners decide to invest in special equipment
  like a water purifier or a home water filtration system.

## How is the taste and quality of water determined?

In accordance with the research by experts, there are many places where tap water contains far more good ingredients for health than store-bought bottled water. Nevertheless, people often give up drinking tap water - mostly because of its poor taste or smell. Are those features a sign of poor quality? Quite the contrary! **Unusual smell or taste are typically indicators of various processes used in water purification.** It is important, however, to evaluate what kind of smell it is. Sometimes it might signify a lower quality of water and e.g. too high iron or calcium concentration.

If there are visible sediments and larger residues - dust and rust particles in tap water, it is quite a different matter. It doesn't indicate a low quality of water, but a poor condition of the plumbing. This problem can be resolved by special home water purifier. **It usually contains mechanical cartridges which stop any particles on their surface.**

{:.distinction.distinction-quotation.distinction-negative}

Residues and small particles in a water system do not only influence the taste and quality of water. It might also cause damage in some elements of the system.

The chemical composition of water from water supply network in most cases is unquestionable. One should, however, pay attention to the smell and color of the liquid coming from their own water supply. If something seems suspicious and you detect a strange aftertaste: metallic, salty or bitter - you might want to do a research. You might also **get a sample of the water tested in a physicochemical lab**, to make sure everything is alright.

## What is the reason for water taste issues?

Water taste is affected by many factors. The major role is played by chemical compounds. The condition of the plumbing and the temperature are also important aspects. **Each of them influences how the water looks and tastes**.

Many people are concerned about tap water quality. In reality, if the water is supplied from the local waterworks, the fear might be completely unjustified. Water supply providers are obliged to **constantly control the water quality - even several times a day**. In case of any irregularities, they must be diagnosed immediately. If there is any problem, the water supply is temporarily cut off and a warning message is issued.

**The chemical taste which is common for tap water is a result of disinfection processes using chlorine**. It is one of the most frequently mentioned problems reported by tap water users. It doesn't mean, however, that water from a private well is flawless. In this case, a taste of iron is a common issue. Everything depends on the location and depth of the source.

## Water from your own source - is it healthier than the one from a provider?

It is believed that water from your own well has a better quality than the one from a local water supply system. What is the reality? **By connecting the house to the water main, one can be sure that the water is safe**, which has been already explained. Regular testing eliminates the presence of dangerous substances. In case of private wells, one has to control the water quality themselves. It is often neglected due to the amount of money charged for the procedure.

## How to purify water at home using carbon water filters?

A popular method for improving the taste of water involves using a special **home water filter**. Are you wondering which water purifier is the best? The most commonly used filters contain activated carbon. They not only improve the taste, but also **eliminate contamination**. This type of water filtration works like a catalyst. It helps to remove various organic compounds, pesticides and - when using a better quality water purifier - heavy metals as well.

## Smell of the water - is it possible to change it?

To change an unpleasant smell of water, the already mentioned carbon water filters are used. Whole-house water filter is one of the options. One can also use a water purifier at one spot only - an under sink water filter is quite a common solution.

There are also other water filtration methods available on the market. A water softener is one of them - it can improve the taste of water. If the water quality issues are more serious, a **home water filtration system** might be the best option.

## Is water filter pitcher enough for water purification?

**Home water filtration usually involves using a water filter pitcher or special bottles.** It's the easiest way to improve water quality. It's widely appreciated, as one doesn't have to install a special water filtration system, and it can be used anywhere. The mentioned bottles with a filter are commonly used for travelling.

But are such products enough? Keep in mind that water filtration used in such equipment is nothing else than using the previously described carbon filters. While they can **improve water quality in terms of taste and smell,** the effect is not that spectacular. Another issue is the fact that this solution allows for purification of only small amount of water, which in some cases might be problematic.

## Water filtration solutions - which water purifier is the best?

There are various types of water filters available on the market, with different parameters. The major difference is the construction. Filters for pitchers are different from those for bottles or for under sink systems. Home water filters also have **different efficiency and capability.** Apart from the mentioned carbon filter, there are other types of water filtration system cartridges.

The simplest types are **mesh, string and foam water filters. They are also called mechanical or sediment filters.** Thanks to them, the water filtration system eliminates sand and rust particles, invisible to the naked eye. The efficiency of such cartridges depends on their density and how large particles they can stop.

Iron water filters are another popular option, used mostly for private wells. **Similar to mechanical cartridges, they are usually installed on pipes in a special casing of appropriate size and construction.** The role of such equipment is removing harmful iron compounds. They also partially remove nitrogen or even hydrogen sulfide.

Many households have a problem of **so-called hard water**. It means that it contains a lot of calcium and magnesium. It's not an issue either, as an appropriate water softening filter will remove the sediments from the liquid.

## Multimedia filter tank - how does a modern water purification system work?

A multimedia filter is one of the best choices for a household. This type of device is **highly efficient**. Thanks to this, the water purifier can remove various types of substances. Depending on the medium, various results can be achieved.

**The medium is nothing else than special material filling of the tank,** which absorbs harmful substances. Depending on the type, one needs to wash it out or regenerate it from time to time. There is also another important aspect - a water purifier like a filter tank needs to be connected with the electric network and sewage system.

## Home water filtration system - is a reverse osmosis filter worth installing?

If you want to have a good quality tap water, choose **complete solutions which provide effective and thorough filtration**. A reverse osmosis system is one of the most commonly chosen solutions among people who decide to give up bottled water.

This type of home water filtration system works across several levels, depending on the particular system. It can have five or six filtration levels. A reverse osmosis filter contains mechanical, carbon, iron and softening cartridges. A water filtration system of this type can also use additional filters which enrich the water with minerals.

{:.distinction.distinction-info.distinction-positive}

A home water filtration system with a reverse osmosis filter significantly improves smell, taste and composition of water. Thanks to this, beverages and meals taste significantly better.

Do you care about the environment and your own savings? Choose tap instead of bottled water. All you need is a home water filtration system and proper water purification so that you will be able to enjoy a good quality water. If you do not have to overpay and you can benefit from it - it is definitely a solution worth choosing.
