The next step is **the surface preparation and leveling.** To do this, use a trowel. Then, prime the substrate. Another important issue is drawing help lines. If you want to lay the tiles currently, plan the layout on the floor or wall. It is generally advised to lay tile starting form the second row.

**Preparing tile mortar mix -** it's another crucial point. Follow the instructions on the packaging. Then, put the mortar on the wall. Use a small trowel to transfer the substance onto a floating trowel and spread it upwards with the toothed side, so that there are visible lines in the mortar.

Many homeowners dream of a perfectly even floor without any unaesthetic gaps. **A flawless, smooth floor makes the room look elegant and minimalistic, and creates an impression of a larger space.** But is it possible to lay tiles so that the gaps between them are invisible? Apparently, nothing is impossible nowadays. Laying tiles this way, however, might pose a certain risk. Check it before you decide on a particular solution.

### What is the purpose of grout?

Grout is a type of a flexible joint placed between the tiles. Its function is both protective and decorative. **The main, most important purpose of grout is concealing the differences between the sizes of the tiles.** Without it, gaps between the elements become very apparent, which disrupts the whole effect.

{:.distinction.distinction-info.distinction-negative}

Apart from the ornamental function, the product also protects the tile from various types of damage and harmful external factors. It secures the floor and wall from moisture, prevents the dust and dirt from accumulating in the creases, and eliminates fungi and mould. Filling the gaps thoroughly with grouting also increases the grip of the tile to the spot it has been glued.

What's more, grout is useful not only for laying tiles, but also **when** **a single damaged tile needs replacement.** Thanks to the filler, one can do that without damaging other element surrounding the tile.

### Is it possible to lay tile with invisible grout?

How to lay tile without grout - it is one of the most common questions from aesthetes and lovers of minimalist interiors. Is it possible at all? **The answer is: yes!** Keep in mind, however, that to do it, one has to use special rectified tile. Elements of this type have been cut to a perfectly even shape right after burning.

{:.distinction.distinction-quotation.distinction-positive}

Rectified tile is perfect both for bathrooms and kitchens. This type of flooring looks best in larger rooms, where the size of the room highlights the smoothness of the surface. The tiles fit to minimalist interiors with a limited amount of furniture and decorations.

### What is the risk of laying floor tile without grout?

Although laying tile without grout is possible, one should consider whether it is a good idea. The lack of grout makes the flooring or wall surface more vulnerable and prone to damage. Without any joint, the elements lose their grip, which makes laying tile more complicated. In addition, there is also a risk that a poorly embedded element cracks, crumbles or even completely falls off the surface. Floor tiles without grout are also more prone to letting moisture, bacteria and mold underneath.

{:.distinction.distinction-quotation.distinction-positive}

The fact that it is impossible to disasemble this type of tile is one of its biggest disadvantages. When one of the elements gets damaged, it cannot be replaced without breaking the rest of the tiles located next to it.

As stressed by specialists, minimizing the grout to a safe thickness and choosing its aesthetics is a much better solution. This effect is easy to achieve with the aforementioned modern tile leveling system.

You gathered a huge portion of knowledge - now you are ready to lay tile by yourself. Just choose the right type of tile and collect all necessary tools - and you can start working.
