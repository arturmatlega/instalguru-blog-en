## Why is it important to install the sink properly?

A proper sink installation - regardless of its type has a tremendous effect on its correct functioning. It is also important because of the leak tightness. **Even the smallest mistakes during a sink installation pose the risk of leaks, or in more serious situations - flooding the whole room.** If the sink installation is poorly done, you might expect that the water inside of the system is not going to flow properly. It limits the functionality of the bathroom. Therefore, one should follow certain rules for sink installation, to avoid further complications.

## How to plumb a bathroom sink?

There are several methods for bathroom sink installation. A lot depends on the **type of** **equipment you choose.** A wall-hung bowl is attached to the wall with bolts and brackets. You can use a sink set with all needed elements. There are also other types of bathroom ceramics. For this reason, a vanity unit is installed in a completely different way. It is placed on a cupboard or combined with it. Plumbing a sink looks different in each of those cases.

## Wall-mount sinks - how to install them?

Installing a wall hung sink usually does not make any problems. It depends on the shape of the sanitary wares of this type - round or rectangular. For some homeowners, the drain trap might be a minus, as it remains visible. There are, however, two options which might resolve the problem. One might purchase an aesthetic looking, chromium plated drain trap, matching the rest of the bathroom elements. Another option is hiding the sink trap behind a pedestal or a trap cover.

The latter solution is particularly attractive for those who have chosen the glamour or industrial style for their bathroom. It's a great decorative element.

The installation of the sink should be started by placing an automatic sink waste in the drain. Then install the faucet. **During both of those steps, remember to insert seals** **protecting the sink from leaking**. Attach the sink trap and insert a drain pipe into the side of the element and screw the cap. You can do it easily by yourself, and what's more - it can be done manually - special tools are not necessary.

## How to install a vanity unit?

Vanity units are one of the most popular bathroom sinks. They look perfect in modern Scandinavian style interiors. They are typically round or elliptical. The market offers a wide variety of equipment in this type, therefore anyone can fit an ideal product to their individual needs.

Installation should start from cutting two holes in the cupboard - for a faucet and for a drain. Then place the bowl in the right opening. It is attached to the spot with transparent silicone, which looks aesthetically.

Spread the substance on the edges of the basin and press it against the cupboard so that it fits well. Don't worry if you have put too much silicone. Just wipe the excess using a soft, damp cloth. The last step of vanity unit installation involves plumbing the trap the appliances to the water system. Use flexible hoses or copper pipes for this purpose.

Remember to turn off the main water supply before starting the installation. This way you can avoid unpleasant surprises.

## Sink faucet installation - do not forget about it!

If you have chosen a particular sink, remember to fit a proper faucet to it. The choice is quite broad in this regard. You can choose between a deck or wall mounted faucet. A lot depends on you individual preferences and the available space. Smaller deck mounted faucets are perfect for small bathroom sinks - they look aesthetic. Wall mounted faucets, on the other hand, are fantastic for larger vanity units. You could even install two separate faucets, for an increased convenience of the family members.

{:.distinction.distinction-quotation.distinction-positive}

Installing a wall-mounted faucet is definitely easier. It should be placed on the wall - over the basin. To do this, special seals and eccentrics are used.

To install a deck mounted sink faucet, it needs to be attached to the upper surface of the basin. The set typically contains special seals, screw and connecting hoses.

## Other sanitary wares - bath and toilet installation

**Sink installation is not everything.** A functional bathroom should also have a WC and a bath tub or a shower stall. If you want to finish the room completely - keep in mind those elements as well. What should you remember when installing them?

### Installing a bath - plumbing

The basic issue when installing a bath tub is its location. The most commonly chosen spots to place it are bathroom walls. This way, you can preserve some space. Pay attention to the ground - **the floor should be even** so that the bath is stable. How to install a bath tub? Start from the legs - attach them to the bath and regulate their height.

If you are sure that the bath is correctly fitted, tighten the legs. Then, **attach the trap and drain pipe in a suitable spot**. Similar to sink installation - remember to put the seals on both elements, so that the newly created system doesn’t leak. Is that all when it comes to a bath tub installation? One, final issue remains. The bath hose needs attaching to the special drain hole. Afterwards - apply silicone on the edges and connect the bath tub with the wall.

### How to install a toilet?

Another, highly important element in every bathroom is a toilet bowl. Installing a toilet looks similar, although it might differ depending on the type. If you have a classic model, start the toilet installation from inserting a **flushing mechanism** into the largest opening. Similar to the other cases, remember to put a seal on it. The two remaining holes are intended for bolts and caps.

The flush should be positioned in the tank and all pieces secured with polypropylene nuts. The whole appliance must be stable. Make sure that the flush doesn’t budge.

The last step of a toilet installation is connecting the pipe. Insert a rubber offset pan connector into the drainpipe located in the bathroom floor. It needs to be connected with the vertical outlet of the toilet bowl. Mark spots for bolts. Place the bowl on the floor, aligning it with the bolt spots. Screw the bolts and insert wall plugs. Align the toilet bowl once again and screw it firmly, using a socket wrench. Make sure that the toilet is fixed in place and that it doesn’t budge. Put caps on the bolts. The flush should be attached to the valve using toilet accessories - in this case a flexible hose.

For a better result, cover the connection with silicone - the same you have used for bath tub and sink installation.

A functional bathroom is not a problem! Just install the sink and other sanitary wares, using our suggestions.
